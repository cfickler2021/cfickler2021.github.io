    <h1> Are Esthetician's Websites Esthetically Pleasing?</h1>
    <P>What aspects of a website make it good or bad, updated or outdated, or even esthetically pleasing? There is no one thing. A multitude of different factors need to be taken into consideration to define a good website from a bad one. These factors include layout, navigation, code, fonts, colors, photos, and much more. In an attempt to decipher the good websites from the bad, I’ve chosen to review three different esthetician websites, MJM Esthetics, Crafted Aesthetics, and Skin Chic. </P>

    <p> First,<a href="https://mjmesthetics.com/">MJM Esthetics.</a> Although this website is not the worst I’ve seen it’s certainly not the best. It’s inconsistent use of colors and fonts are not esthetically pleasing while it’s unrelatable, modeled photos are less than welcoming. However, before I dive in to all the things I dislike about this website, I should begin by mentioning the things I do.</p>
    <p>The MJM Esthetics website includes a good amount of white space. The white space gives the site a cleaner, more modern look. I also like the personal note and photo located in the about section. This adds a nice personal touch to the website by allowing visitors to learn more about the owner. In addition to personal touches, the website is fairly easy to navigate. For example, if you want to know what services MJM Esthetics provides you can simply use the navigation to click on services where a scrolling list appears. This list contains all the services along with prices and explanations. Easy navigation is crucial to having a good website but, it’s not the only determining factor. There are a multitube of reason why I’ve chosen this as my “bad” website.</p>
    <p>For starters, I dislike the colors, photos, and fonts. I wouldn’t say the website has any main colors. The MJM Esthetics logo, located at the top of the page, is olive green and teal blue. Not only do these cool tones evoke a sadness, they’re inconsistent with other colors featured on the page. MJM Esthetics features a deeper, ocean blue, purple, turquoise, light pink, and tan. It appears as though some of the different blues are trying to match, but they fall short which, for an esthetician’s page, isn’t very esthetically pleasing. Why would you do business with an esthetician who isn’t even esthetically pleasing!</p>
    <p>I also dislike the websites photos. If you scroll down to the bottom of the page there are a variety of photos. These photos are of different products from the same brand. Not only were these photos unappealing they were confusing! Similarly, I noticed the photos with people in them are not of actual clients. They have been taken from a free stock photo website such as pexels. This makes the website appear not only less personable, but also less credible. In searching for services provided by an esthetician, I always like to see the real clients, whether that’s with before and after photos or just after photos. I think this is especially important in a small community like Helena where you may see friends or family members who have chosen to do business with this specific esthetician.</p>
    <p>Finally, I dislike the fonts. For starters, I can count five different fonts on the home page! The logo font is different from the navigation font, which is different from the heading font, which is different from the body font! The navigation menu is a sans-serif font while the headings are a cursive font. Not unlike the colors, these fonts don’t allude to the emotions I want when searching for an esthetician! Regardless of my personal opinions and feelings there are other, more technical aspects of the page that make it bad.</p>
    <p>While the website does use html5, it’s not super clean. In examining the code, I noticed an image being used as text. This is bad because the text and colors of the photo are different from everything else on the site. Overall, this is not the worst website I’ve ever seen, but as I mentioned earlier certainly not the best either. Inconsistencies with fonts, colors, and codes combined with photos that lack a personal touch make this website less than great.</p>


    <p>The second website to review is <a href="https://craftedaestheticmt.com/">Crafted Aesthetics.</a> Crafted Aesthetics is a good website for so many reasons. It’s clean, modern design combined with its fun animated transitions, crafts continuity to the user interface! Likewise, the website’s practical layout provides viewers with easy navigation and appointment booking! Yet, before I go into too much detail, I should discuss the minor things I dislike about the Crafted Aesthetics website.</p>
    <p> If you navigate to the Providers page, visitors will encounter a word rotator. Although unique and somewhat cool, I found the constant slideshow of words slightly distracting. As you scroll down the page to meet the Crafted Family you’ll notice their photos are not headshots. Rather they are cut off, displaying an odd section from neck to waistline, depending on the providers pose?! If you hover over these images a transparent, light pink overlay appears and once clicked on, the entire photo reveals itself. While I dislike these aspects, they aren’t exactly deal breakers. The website still contains many things I enjoy, so here are the reasons I consider it good. </p>
    <p>Important for all good websites, Crafted’s layout makes sense. It’s organized like most websites, which makes it easy to navigate. The menu which includes several drop-downs is located at the top. From the navigation menu visitors can easily find the service they’re looking for, book an appointment, meet the team, or shop for products. Another important aspect of all good websites, is code. This website uses html 5 which is clean and modern! Aside from these fundamental, technical elements, I like the site for other details as well. </p>
    <p>I like Crafted Aesthetics colors and fonts. The website doesn’t feature multiple fonts and colors. It features major colors such as black, white, and light pink. The black and white communicate clean and sophisticated, while the soft, light pink reveals kindness and love. These are the feelings I want to associate with an aesthetician. Additionally, there are only two major fonts that are used consistently throughout. Not only does this make the page more aesthetically pleasing, it creates less distraction by providing greater continuity.</p>
    <p>I also like the websites photos. They include photos of actual clients as well as actual team members. This adds a nice personal touch. In fact, when visitors first arrive they are welcomed by a large group photo of the Crafted Family! Dressed in all black and taken in the Crafted Aesthetics location, this photo matches the websites aesthetic. Further, when researching for different services, you’ll find pictures of actual employees demonstrating their craft. For potential clients, this can help establish credibility. </p>
    <p> In addition to colors, fonts, and photos, this website contains a handful of little things I like. For example, if you scroll to the bottom of the home page visitors can view photos from the company’s Instagram page! Or if you scroll to the very bottom of any page, within the site, you’ll find little icons for Google Biz, Instagram, and Facebook, making Crafted easy to find on any platform! Another unique feature of this website is it’s fun animated transitions. For instance, on the home page there’s a button containing the words, View Our Crafts and Services. If clicked on, a cool animation ensues! Overall, Crafted Aesthetics has a great website worth visiting.</p>


    <p> <a href="https://www.skinchic.com/">Skin Chic</a> is the third and final website I’ve chosen to discuss. This website is another good one. Its sleek design and easy layout make it both esthetically pleasing and easily accessible for visitors. In fact, there’s not much to complain about. The layout is typical for majority of websites today, making navigation easy and enjoyable. There is a header containing Skin Chic’s logo and navigation menu. There’s also a footer containing a subscribe button and links to their Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. Having a layout that makes sense, is always one of the first things I look for in a good website, but it’s not the only thing. I also inspected the page for clean, up to date code. I found it uses elements from html5 which is also good. </p>
    <p>These technical aspects are important, but there are other things I like about Skin Chic’s website. I like the websites consistency with both colors and fonts. It’s main colors, similar to Crafted Aesthetics, are black, white, and soft pink. Again, these colors evoke the same feelings of sophisticated, clean and kind. The fonts are also consistent. I only count three fonts used throughout the entire website. One of which is a gentle, girly cursive, which I think is fitting for an esthetician website. </p>
    <p>The Skin Chic website also has good photos. These are photos of real team members and clients. As I’ve mentioned before, this makes the website more personable and credible for visitors that are looking to become potential clients! The website also features testimonials under each of their services, furthering adding to the sites credibility. All in all, Skin Chic has a good website with easy layout, up to date code, and aesthetically pleasing design elements! </p>
