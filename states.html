    <h1>5 State Websites Ranked and Reviewed</h1>

    <h2>1. Vermont</h2>
    <p>I rated the Green Mountain State #1 and here's why:</p>

    <p>First of all, it loaded quickly. This is important to users who want to access the site. Second, the page is fairly pleasing to the eye. The website has achieved a modern feel by encorporating a clean, simple design. The site uses white and gray while all other color comes from photos on the site. That is except for thier logo which is a little, dark green mountain. Hence the Green Mountain State! In addition to being aesthetically pleasing, the Vermont website's navigation menu was super easy to access. Located in the header, it included six drop down menus for Live, Work, Explore, Learn, Government, and Online Services. These menus seemed both specific and broad enough to provide users with easy navigation. Visitors to the site should have no trouble finding whatever it is they're looking for. AND if, for some reason users are having trouble, the site contains a big search bar located directly under the menu in the middle of a photo! Finally, it functions well in multiple screen sizes. Whether you're accessing the site from your phone, tablet, or the biggest monitor on the planet, Vermont's state website will be able to easy to use! </p>

    <h2>2. Tennessee</h2>
    <p>The Volunteer State takes home the silver and here's why:</p>

    <p>Again, their website loaded quickly as did the additional pages I accessed, so that's good! Similarly, it's fairly eye-pleasing and modern when compared to other websites included in this review. Tennessee uses dark blue and various reds giving it a very patriotic vibe. 'Merica! The menu, again, is located in the header. It's easy to find. However, Tennessee's menu includes eight items, Careers, Residents, Business, Governemtn, Directory, Help, TransparentTN, and Tennessee Public Charter School Commission. These make the site easier to navigate allowing users to find exactly what their looking for. Yet, these menus contained smaller font than that of Vermont's site. In turn, they were more difficult to read, especially from a smaller screen! Which leads me to why Tennessee ranks #2. I could not get the site to load on my phone! This is NOT good, considering a lot of people are now accessing their favorite sites via smaller, mobile devices. Therefore, this site does not work well with multiple screen sizes because 1) I couldn't get it to even load and 2) even if I could, I know the font would be too small to read. Overall, the Volunteer State website is pretty good. It's fairly modern and eye catching, it's easy to navigate, and contains a search bar in the upper right-hand corner if you're struggling. Nevertheless, it is not accessible on multiple screens. Hence second place! </p>

    <h2>3. Iowa</h2>
    <p> Why The Hawkeye State is just middle of the road:</p>

    <p>This site loaded quickly but when you first get to the landing page, the content isn't even centered! There is also an abundance of blue! The Iowa state website's lack of white space makes it feel less clean and modern. In turn, making it less appealing. On the other hand, the menu is easy to locate. They even included little icons for each of the seven menu items which are home, business, governemnt, health, education, general, and contact. I liked the icons as well as how they've organized and categoriezed the menu. However, despite being categorized well, I found it difficult to find what I was looking for. Often times by clicking on a drop down, you were transported to an entirely different website, while other times you weren't. This is potentially confusing for users. Likewise, if you can't find what you're looking for quickly and efficiently then is that website really fulfilling it's purpose? The one really good apect of the Iowa state website is that it's actually more appealing and easier to use from a smaller screen. This is convenient for those on the go who like to pull up the site from thier phone or tablet. Simply put, this is not the worst website but certainly not the best! </p>

    <h2>4. Oklahoma</h2>
    <p>Why The Sooner State ranks second to last:</p>

    <p>At first glance, this website seems pretty good! It's clean, modern, and aesthetically pleasing. The use of bright photos pairs nicely with their colorful logo which contains blue, green, red, and yellow. Of all five websites included in this review, the Oklahoma website is arguably the best looking. However, don't let it's good looks fool you. There is no menu located in the header, which makes navigation difficult from the get go. In order to successfully find what you're looking for, you must click in the upper right-hand corner on a little thing that says State Agencies. This then pulls down a long list of categories including, Business and Employment, Communinity and Culture, Education, Environmental and Natural Resources, Family and Health, Finacning, General Services, Information Technology, Insurance, ect. In total, there is a whopping seventeen different categories. The abundance of categories makes them more specific. This is somewhat nice as it may make it easieer to find what you're looking for. Yet, it does no good if no one can find the menu in the first place. This could be challenging for some because the menu is not located in a typical location. Finally, this website does work well with multiple screen sizes and it loaded quickly. But in the end, I ranked The Sooner State fourth simply because the menu is difficult to find. Thus, makiing it harder for the website to fulfill it's purpose. </p>

    <h2>5. Alaska</h2>
    <p>The Last Frontier State takes the cake for worst state website and here's why:</p>

    <p>Clearly, the Alaska state website is not the best. It loaded quickly, but after that I wasn't to impressed. It's old school, early 2000's vibe is not the most eye-pleasing. The website is blue and yellow, but mostly blue. In addition, the website seems crammed and busy. The menu is easily found and inlcudes categories such as Home, Resident, Business, Visitor, and State Employees. I think one could find what they're looking for however, it may take a lot of scrolling and or reading and who likes reading? Similarly the font is relatively small which would make it difficult to read on a smaller screen! Given that, the Alaska state website would not pair well with different size screens. Overall, there are definately worse sites out there but, of these five I thought the Alaska website was weakest! </p>
